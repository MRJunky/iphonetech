<h2>Description</h2>
<ul>
 <li>
		<p>Compatible with iOS 10.</p><br>
		<p><strong>Immortal</strong></p>
		<p>Prevent expiration of signed iOS applications & bypass 3 free signed applications per device limit.</p>
		<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
		<p>After installing Immortal, you can use Cydia Impactor to install unlimited number of applications and games that are signed just using a free Apple ID. They will live on your iDevice forever and will never get expired or revoked.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
		<p>Don't forget that Immortal is a tweak, and only works when your device is in jailbroken state. This means even after installing Immortal, you should manage signing of main Yalu application like before, to be able to put your device in jailbroken mode. But after jailbreaking using Yalu and going into jailbroken state, Immortal takes care of everything and opens every signed application for you, whether they are broken or revoked.</p>
